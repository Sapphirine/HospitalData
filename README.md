* listingbydrg.html:

The "Listing by DRG" code allows a user to search on a specific diagnosis-related group (a cluster of conditions) and find out how far the hospital is from the user. 
Example: Let's say a patient has bronchitis with no other diseases. The patient selects bronchitis and asthma without CC (meaning comorbid condition). The user can then find out the least, most and average charging of treatment at hospitals across the nation. Below, this field is automatically populated in the destination field of the map interface. The user can type their location in the origin search box to find out how far the hospital is from the patient. By pressing the calculate distance button, the driving duration and the distance to the hospital appear.

* listingbycost.html:

The "Listing by Cost" code allows a user to search on a specific hospital and find out how far the hospital is from the user.
Example: The patient is located in Woburn, MA. The patient has been going to Winchester Hospital in Winchester, MA for the last few years and is interested in how much the hospital charges. If the patient searches for Winchester Hospital, they will find out how the charges relate to the nation's average. Below this, the destination field of the map interface is automatically populated. If the user searches their current address, they can find out how far the hospital is from them. The user enters their address in the search box next to the "Origin" label and presses the calculate distance button to determine these values.
